Challenge Name : Scooby and The Ghost of Captain Cutle.


Description:Made in c++, This Challenge requires 3 passcodes to get the flag.

1)The first one is a simple string compare that has nothing to do with the flag.It was created as a warmup.PassCode:Good_Old_Times

2)The second Passcode ,Is the first half of the flag.It is encryted with a substitution cypher which replaces you character with the next character in the keyboard(QWERTY).(For the most part).
Pass:A_Tr1P_D0Wn_Th

3)The Third is relatively easy if u know ROT13.It takes the input and ROT13s it and then reverses  it.Then it is compared to the flag fromed in the same way.
pass:3_Sc0oBy_L4n3

If you get 2 and 3 right it will combine both parts to give you the flag.


Flag:Bi0s{A_Tr1P_D0Wn_Th3_Sc0oBy_L4n3}
