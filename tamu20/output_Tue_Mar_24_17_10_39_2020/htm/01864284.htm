Not available in all areas. Special equipment may be required. Actual speeds over DSL lines will vary depending on several factors including location of your home, computer performance and configuration, network or Internet congestion, Web sites accessed and current phone line conditions. Speed of service, uninterrupted and error free service is not guaranteed.   Some customers may require professional installation which may be obtained for an extra charge. You must additionally subscribe to MSN Internet Access in accordance with its Subscription Agreement to access the service.  A valid major credit card may be required.  If for any reason your subscription is terminated during the initial 24 month period then you will be required to return the DSL modem provided to you. 
If you do not return the modem you will be charged $150 plus applicable taxes. The current price for the unlimited MSN Broadband Internet Access Plan will be automatically charged to you beginning on the activation date and until you cancel your account or select an alternative plan.  You must be 18 years old or older.  MSN Broadband Internet Access is available only to users of Windows® 98  or later.  MSN Internet Access is available only for personal non-commercial use.  Additional terms may apply if you are a current MSN Internet Access member.  Offer expires on December 31, 2001.
Your subscription includes 10 hours per month of dialup internet access.  Local phone and/or long distance toll charges may apply for dial-up access.  It is the customer's responsibility to check with a local phone company to determine if dial-up access numbers are local.  Dial-up access in excess of 10 hours per month will be billed at the rate of $1.50/hour plus applicable taxes.  Local market network activity and capacity may affect dial-up access availability.
