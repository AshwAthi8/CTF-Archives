	<h5 ID=loc8>What is the Internet?</h5>
	<P ID=loc9>Simply put, the Internet is a large set of computer networks that communicate with each other, often over telephone lines. It enables companies, organizations, individuals, schools, and governments to share information across the world.</P>
	<P ID=loc10>The Internet includes the World Wide Web, which enables you to see documents in richly formatted text and pictures. Many Web pages link to other Web pages, so it's easy to browse, or &quot;surf&quot;, a large amount of information by just clicking with your mouse.</P>

	<h5 ID=loc17>Connecting to the Internet</h5>
	<P ID=loc18>Connecting to the Internet involves a modem, a phone line, and an Internet service provider (ISP). An ISP is a company that provides you with Internet connection service through your phone line. You'll find a wide range of ISPs that provide different services, such as e-mail or your own Web page, and pricing levels. If you want, you can choose one in the Internet Connection wizard.</P>
