 network storage devices that are mapped as logical disks on the computer system. The instances returned for this class will be as follows.
If user A is enumerating the instances, then the provider will look for a logon session of user A on that machine. If there is one (and only one) such logon session, then the provider will return the mapped drives of that session. If there is more than one session that user A has on the machine, then no mapped drive instances will be returned (since the provider has no reasonable way of deciding which session to use). If there are no sessions of user A running, and there is a locally logged on user B, then the provider will impersonate A and return the mapped drives of user B. This case supports the scenario of helpdesk wanting to see the instances of a locally logged on user. Again, if there is more than one session of user B running on the machine, then the provider has no way of deciding which to use. In this case no mapped drive instances will be returned.
