	<h5 ID=loc8>What is the Internet?</h5>
	<P ID=loc9>Simply put, the Internet is a large set of computer networks that communicate with each other, often over telephone lines. It enables companies, organizations, individuals, schools, and governments to share information across the world.</P>
	<P ID=loc10>The Internet includes the World Wide Web, which enables you to see documents in richly formatted text and pictures. Many Web pages link to other Web pages, so it's easy to browse, or &quot;surf&quot;, a large amount of information by just clicking with your mouse.</P>
