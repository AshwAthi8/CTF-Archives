<p class="title">Tips for creating a good password</>
<p class="header2">What is a password? </p>
<p>A password is a combination of characters and numbers that is used in conjunction 
with your account name to sign in to your account.
Like a key, your password restricts access to your account.</p>

<p>Your password will always show up on the screen as asterisks
so no one can see it and sign in without your permission. 
Memorize your password and be cautious about sharing your password with others. </p>

<p class="header2">Password Rules</p>
<p>The foundation of online safety is a strong, secret password. 
Use the following password rules and tips
when creating or changing your password.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Your password must be at least 8 characters long, but no longer than 16 characters.
    It may contain numbers (0-9) and upper and lowercase letters (A-Z, a-z), but no blank spaces.
</li>
  <li>
   Your password is case-sensitive, so note which letters you capitalize.</li>
  <li>
   Use a combination of letters and numbers, such as px3up469.</li>
</ul>
<BR>
<p class="header2">Password Tips</p>
<p>Never use a password that is
easy to guess. Your birth date, Social Security number, and children's names are
easy targets.</p>
<p>Your password should not
contain your e-mail name, your first name or last name.</p>
<p>Never write your password on
paper. Use a password you can remember.</p>
<p>Don't use dictionary words
from any language.</p>
<p>Never send your password by
e–mail or in an instant message.</p>

<p class ="title">MSN Statement of Privacy</P>
<P><P><B>MSN wants to help you maintain your privacy on the Internet </B></P> <font face=arial,sans-serif size=2>
 <P>The Internet is an amazing tool. It has the power to change the way we live, and we're starting to see that
  potential today. With only a few mouse-clicks, you can follow the news, look up facts, buy goods and services, 
  and communicate with others from around the world--even people you might never have met. It's important to 
  Microsoft to help its customers retain their privacy when they take advantage of all the Internet has to offer.</P>
   <P>Microsoft is a member of TRUSTe, an independent, non-profit initiative that exists to help people
    such as yourself feel confident about using the Internet for your communication, shopping, research, and living.
	 TRUSTe aims to build this confidence by promoting the principles of disclosure and fair information practices 
	 among the Web sites that participate in the program.</P> <P>What this means to you is, 
	 we are committed to protecting your privacy and developing technology that gives you the most powerful, 
safe, online experience that you can get anywhere.</P> <P><B>TRUSTe Certification</B></P>
Microsoft is a premier sponsor of TRUSTe and a member of the TRUSTe privacy program. TRUSTe is
 an independent, non-profit initiative whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence 
 in the Internet by promoting TRUSTe's principles of fair information practices.</P>
  <P>Questions regarding this statement should be directed to
      MSNPrivacy@msn.com. If the Web site has not responded to your inquiry, or your inquiry 
	  has not been satisfactorily addressed, contact TRUSTe.at www.truste.org/users/watchdog.html</P>

 <P><b>Privacy Principles</b></P> <P>Because your privacy is important to us, MSN sites displaying this privacy statement will operate by the following six principles. Users should additionally consult the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section accompanying this Privacy Statement for more information regarding these principles.</P>

 <P><b>Principle 1.</b> <br>MSN sites will explicitly ask when they need information that personally identifies you or allows them to contact you ("Personally Identifiable Information"). Generally this information is requested when registering for a site, when requesting a particular service, or when entering a sweepstakes or contest. When possible, MSN sites will provide you with the means to make sure that your Personally Identifiable Information is correct and current.</P> 

<P><b>Principle 2.</b> <br>MSN sites and their necessary service partners use your Personally Identifiable Information to operate the sites and services and to inform you of new features, services, and products from Microsoft and its affiliates. Some MSN sites may also carefully select other companies to send you information about their products or services which are related to the site's service but are not necessary to its operation (a "Secondary Use").</P> <P><b>Principle 3.</b> <br>If an MSN site intends to use Personally Identifiable Information for a Secondary Use, the MSN site will provide you with instructions on how to decline this service. You may also stop the delivery of informational or promotional e-mail from MSN sites by following the instructions on the e-mail sent to you.</P> <P><b>Principle 4.</b> <br>MSN Sites are primarily directed to 
online users ages 13 and above. For those MSN sites that require users to provide age information in order to access the site or to participate in the activities offered by the site, MSN will require users who indicate that they are under the age of 13 to get parental consent prior to using the site, by creating a Microsoft Kids Passport account, or the website will attempt to block their access to the site.</P> <P><b>Principle 5.</b> <br>MSN sites may disclose Personally Identifiable Information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Microsoft or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Microsoft, the site or the users of MSN, and (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of 
Microsoft, MSN, the site or the public.</P> <P><b>Principle 6.</b> <br>If at any time you believe that an MSN site has not adhered to these principles, please notify MSN by e-mail at
      MSNPrivacy@msn.com and we will use all commercially reasonable efforts to promptly determine and correct the problem.</P> <P>MSN is committed to maintaining its position as a premier site on the Internet. As our site continues to develop, we may add new services and features to our website. In the event that these additions affect our Privacy Statement, this document will be updated appropriately.</p> <P>For more information about our Privacy Statement, see the following <b>Frequently Asked Questions</b> or the FAQs accompanying the MSN sites.</P> </font> <h1><B><font face="arial,sans-serif" size="4">Frequently Asked Questions</font></B></h1> <font face=arial,sans-serif size=2> <P><b>Do all sites on MSN follow these privacy principles?<br>
      </b>MSN is made up of many sites, and new ones are added all the time. At this time, the MSN privacy statement applies to those sites which display this statement in conjunction with the privacy notice on the site's Web pages. While MSN encourages other site operators on MSN to comply with these principles, users should carefully examine the privacy statements of sites appearing on or linking to or from MSN which do not display this statement. Personal Information that you choose to provide to other sites will be subject to the privacy policies of that Web site.</P> <P><b>How will users know which privacy statement applies to their personal information?<br>
      </b>Pages throughout MSN display a &quot;Privacy Statement&quot; link which identifies the privacy statement applying to the site. Users may click on the link at any time to read the applicable privacy statement. MSN Websites can be identified by the MSN logo appearing in the top left-hand corner of the screen.</P> <P><b>Why is TRUSTe so important?</b><br>
      TRUSTe is an independent organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence on the Internet.  Businesses that display the TRUSTe logo have agreed to privacy principles developed by TRUSTe and to periodic reviews to make sure that the businesses' privacy practices are in keeping with the policies. In the event TRUSTe learns of serious violations of a businesses' privacy practices, TRUSTe takes steps to insure compliance.  Microsoft strongly believes in the TRUSTe mission and is a premier sponsor of the organization.</P> <P><b>Does Microsoft belong to any other privacy organizations?<br>
      </b>Microsoft has taken a leadership position on privacy, working closely with both policy and technology organizations to create standards and best practices for putting people in control of their Personal Information online. Amongst others, Microsoft is a member of
      TRUSTe, the Online Privacy Alliance and the P3P Working Group at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and international organizations working on these issues.</P> <P><b>How do MSN sites collect the Personally Identifiable Information?<br>
      </b>Personally Identifiable Information is collected by specifically requesting it from you. Generally this occurs when you register at a site, request a service, or enter an online contest or sweepstakes.</P> <P><b>What about &quot;Cookies&quot;?<br>
      </b>&quot;Cookies&quot; are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. &quot;Cookies&quot; can make the Web more useful by storing information about your preferences on a particular site, such as your preferred chart settings for MSN Encarta. The use of &quot;Cookies&quot; is an industry standard, and many major Web sites use them to provide useful features for their customers. &quot;Cookies&quot; in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user's computer. Most browsers are initially set to accept &quot;Cookies&quot;. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse &quot;Cookies&quot;. However, you may not be able to take full advantage of a Web site if you do so. For example, the subscription services of MSN Encarta may only be accessed if you 
	  accept &quot;Cookies.&quot;</P> <P><b>How do MSN sites use Personally Identifiable Information?<br>
      </b>Usually, MSN sites and their necessary service partners use your Personally Identifiable Information to operate the site and to deliver their services. For example, if you are using MSN HomeAdvisor, a completed mortgage application may at your request be forwarded to potential lenders. MSN sites also use your Personally Identifiable Information to inform you of other products or services available from Microsoft and its affiliates. Some MSN sites also use Personally Identifiable Information to allow other companies to contact you regarding products and services that may be of interest to you (Secondary Uses). If an MSN site proposes to use Personally Identifiable Information for Secondary Uses, you will be provided an opportunity to instruct the MSN site to not allow such contact. You may also check the
      "MSN Personal Information Center" to view, edit, or delete your information. This new service allows you to delete your personal information from MSN's database.  Not all sites are represented at the Center today.  Keep checking as we add more MSN sites and services to the Center in the near future.</P> <P><b>Does that mean MSN sites sell my Personally Identifiable Information to other companies?<br>
      </b>No, MSN does not sell customer lists. However, individual MSN sites may partner with businesses to provide special services to our customers. This type of use of Personally Identifiable Information is called a "Secondary Use" because it is not necessary to the operation of the business or site. For example, a site may offer discount coupons for services or related products. In many cases these discounts would be an added benefit to our customers.</P> <P><b>What if I do not want my Personally Identifiable Information shared with another company?<br>
      </b>If an MSN site proposes to make a Secondary Use of your Personally Identifiable Information, the MSN site will provide you with instructions on how to decline this service. You may also stop the delivery of future informational or promotional mail from MSN sites by following the instructions on the mail sent to you. In addition, you may visit the
      "MSN Personal Information Center" to view, edit or delete your personal information from the MSN database. Not all sites are represented at this time; we will be adding more MSN sites and services to the Center in the near future.</P> <P><b>What about companies that partner with MSN sites to provide the products or services on a site?<br>
      </b>An MSN site may have several necessary service partners who assist in providing the service or product associated with the site. As part of the operations of the site, these companies may have access to your Personally Identifiable Information. These companies may provide routine services, such as credit card processing, or may provide essential elements of the site. For example, MSN CarPoint must provide contact information to automotive dealers in order to respond to specific requests made by customers. Without this relationship MSN CarPoint could not provide its service to you. These uses of Personally Identifiable Information are primary to the operation of the site and are not considered Secondary Uses.</P> <P><b>What about the privacy of Personally Identifiable Information collected from users under the age of 13?<br>
      </b>Safeguarding the Personally Identifiable Information of our online users under the age of 13 is extremely important. For those MSN sites where users have indicated they are under the age of 13, MSN will require parental consent for their child to use the website or the services it offers. Microsoft Kids Passport allows parents to consent to the collection, use and sharing of their children's information with Microsoft and the sites and services operated by or for Microsoft (including MSN).  MSN sites will collect the minimum amount of Personally Identifiable Information necessary to the operation of the service.  To to view the Microsoft Kids Passport website and Privacy Statement visit http://www.passport.com/consumer </P> <P><b>Do MSN sites collect other forms of information about its users?<br>
      </b>No, for many MSN sites it is not necessary for you to provide any information in order for them to provide their services. In other instances, the MSN site may request minimal information, such as your ZIP code, in order to personalize the site. ZIP codes allow the site to provide targeted services, such as the local news or weather, but do not provide the site with any information regarding who you are or how to contact you. Other MSN sites need more information about you in order to operate their service. For example, CarPoint needs your name and other contact information in order to allow its service partners to respond to your request for more information about a particular vehicle.</P> <P><b>How do I correct or change Personally Identifiable Information that I have given to an MSN site?<br>
      </b>Some MSN sites operate registration pages that allow you to review and update the Personally Identifiable Information you have submitted. Elsewhere, you are simply given the option of unsubscribing to the service for which you signed up. In all other cases where you need to correct Personally Identifiable Information you have submitted to an MSN site, please contact the service address published by the particular MSN site.</P> <P>In addition, MSN has created a new feature, the MSN Personal Information Center. There you may choose to edit your personally identifiable information at certain MSN sites. Not all sites are represented at this time; we will be adding more MSN sites and services to the Center in the near future.&nbsp;</P> <P><b>Is my Personally Identifiable Information secure from others using the MSN site?<br>
      </b>Personally Identifiable Information collected by MSN sites is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public. In many instances, such as in the case of credit card numbers, the Personally Identifiable Information is encrypted before you conduct your transaction.</P> <P><b>How else might someone learn of my Personally Identifiable Information while visiting an MSN site?<br>
      </b>In addition to directly providing information to an MSN site, you might also provide Personally Identifiable Information through chat sessions, e-mail exchanges or newsgroups made available to you on MSN. The Statement of Privacy does not cover this type of transfer of your Personally Identifiable Information. You should always be careful when distributing your Personally Identifiable Information in this manner. And remember that online chat sessions and newsgroup use is considered public and you are responsible for your actions in these areas.</P> <P><b>Do MSN sites collect other forms of information about its users?<br>
      </b>In addition to the use of Personally Identifiable Information to operate MSN sites, an MSN site may also gather anonymous information, which may be used by Microsoft or shared with third parties. This is information which does not personally identify you, but which may be helpful for marketing purposes or for improving the services we offer. For example, MSN might tell its advertisers how many users visited a particular advertisement, and for how long, so they can measure whether the advertisement was effective. This information is also used to generate advertising rates. Generally this information is collected through "traffic data" and may entail the use of "Cookies," "IP addresses," or other numeric codes used to identify a computer.</P> <P><b>How else might someone learn of my Personally Identifiable Information while visiting an MSN site?<br>
      </b>In addition to directly providing information to an MSN site, you might also provide Personally Identifiable Information through chat sessions, e-mail exchanges or newsgroups made available to you on MSN.

<A NAME="MSNX"></a><p class=title>MSN Explorer Privacy Statement</P>
<p class = header2>What Personal Information is Collected</p>
<p>When you sign up for MSN Explorer, we request 
registration information including personally identifiable information such as your name
and address, as well as non-personally identifiable information including your occupation and other
demographic information. Once you are registered, MSN will recognize you on your future visits to MSN Explorer. 
Through MSN Explorer registration, you will have also created a Microsoft Passport account.
For more information about Passport and the Passport services, go to www.passport.com.</p> 

<p>MSN Explorer gathers anonymous information, such as how many times a user attempts to log on,
the average time for rendering the home page, or the length of time of your session online, 
while performing a continuous service quality monitoring function. MSN performs this service
to help improve the technical quality of the service. The anonymous information does not
contain any personally identifiable information.</p>

<p>MSN Explorer collects and stores your favorite Web page addresses (URLs) 
in your Favorites list on a secure MSN server. This allows you to have your 
Favorites available from whichever computer you use to access MSN Explorer, 
even if you use multiple computers. It synchronizes the list you are using with the 
list on the server so that you can add or delete Favorites from any computer running 
MSN Explorer, anywhere in the world. The sole purpose of storing the information on 
the server is to provide you with the convenience of having your Favorites available 
to you anywhere you use MSN Explorer. Your Favorites are not used 
by MSN for any purpose other than to provide you access to them.</p>

<p>Periodically, you may see a message informing you of a critical performance 
error in MSN Explorer. This message will ask you to send data to MSN. 
If you agree, MSN Explorer will automatically send and collect data needed to help
MSN determine what caused the error.You may choose whether you want to send your 
data to help MSN learn why the error occurred. Before you choose to send your 
data to MSN, you will have an opportunity to review that data. 
If you choose to send the data, in certain instances, your personally
identifiable information may also be sent to MSN. This personally identifiable
information will be deleted prior to the review of the error data you send.</p>

<p class = header2>How MSN Uses Your Information</p>
<p>MSN uses your registration information to authenticate you every time you sign in 
to MSN Explorer. MSN uses anonymous data gathered during service quality monitoring
to improve the technical quality of the MSN Explorer service.</p>

<p>MSN Explorer will not disclose your Favorites list to other MSN sites nor 
share this list with any third parties, except when required to do so by law as described 
 in the MSN Privacy Statement below. MSN does not use your Favorites list to create profiles. 
Nor will you receive marketing materials as a result of storing your Favorites on MSN servers.
When you delete an item from your Favorites, it is deleted from MSN servers 
when you sign out of MSN Explorer.</p> 

<p>MSN uses data gathered in error reporting to learn how to prevent future critical performance
 errors.</p> 
 <p class=header2> Who Else May Receive Your Personal Information?</p>
 All information you share with MSN Explorer is governed by the MSN Privacy Statement,
 except as noted above.</p> 
 
<p class =header2>How Do You Control Your Personal Information?</p>
<p>You may change your personal information, at any time while you are online, 
by clicking <b>Help &amp; Settings</b>, and then clicking <b> Accounts</b>.</p>

<p class=header2>What Personal Information is Collected</p>
<p>When you register to subscribe to our MSN Internet Access service, MSN requests 
personally identifiable information such as your name, e-mail address, physical address,
telephone number, credit card number, and in some instances, your social security
number to register your account.</p>

<p>MSN may also automatically check the version of MSN Internet Access software and components 
you are using (including your browser version) every time you sign into MSN Internet Access 
service in order to optimize performance. MSN may also provide upgrades to such software 
that will be automatically downloaded to your computer.</p>

<p class= header2>How MSN Uses Your Personal Information</p>
<p>Your personally identifiable information may be gathered, processed or used
in the following ways:</p><ul>

<li>To service accounts, process, bill and collect payments pursuant to the MSN Internet Access 
Subscriber Agreement, and otherwise to operate and deliver the MSN Internet Access service you 
have requested. </li>
<li>To support customer questions about subscription, billing, or use of the MSN Internet 
Access service.</li>
<li>To enforce any of the terms of the MSN Internet Access Subscriber Agreement. </li>

<li>To fulfill MSN Internet Access CD and other fulfillment request orders. </li>
<li>To create a Microsoft Passport account and an optional wallet account. </li></p></ul>

<p class= header2>Who Else May Receive Your MSN Internet Access Registration Information?</p>

information with third parties for their use in providing services to Microsoft in the 
course of operating and delivering the MSN Internet Access service, such as to process 
or collect payments, or provide customer support to MSN Internet Access accounts. 
All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except 
to provide these services to Microsoft, and they are required to maintain the 
confidentiality of your information.</p>

representative 24 hours a day, 7 days a week at http://msn.webhelp.com/msn/.</p>

<p>If your account was offered in conjunction with another company through a co-promotion, 
you will be notified upon registration about how to contact the other party to check and correct your information if necessary. In some cases, both MSN and the 
other company with whom you signed up for MSN Internet Access will receive
your registration information.</p>

<p class = header2>How Do I Control My Personal Information?</p>
<p>If you do not wish to receive any special offers on behalf of selected third party companies
or from MSN, after you have signed up and are online, you can access the online version of the
Privacy Statement at http://www.msn.com/help/legal/privacy.htm.  
Scroll down to the section titled "Control Your Personal Information." Then,
click "MSN Communication Preferences." You can review the list of choices on the page and check the appropriate boxes. You will still receive 
communication from MSN Internet Access to alert you to new products, product upgrades, 
special offers and other information related directly to the MSN Internet Access service.</p>

<A NAME="MSNGEN"></a><p class=title>MSN Privacy Statement</P> 
<P>MSN is committed to protecting your privacy and developing technology that gives you the most 
powerful and the safest online experience. This MSN Statement of Privacy applies to Microsoft's MSN 
family of Web sites and governs data collection and usage at all MSN sites and services.</p>
<p class=header2>TRUSTe Certification</p>
<p>This certification confirms that Microsoft and MSN are licensees of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. 
TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build trust and 
confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. Because 
this Web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to 
disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance
by TRUSTe. By displaying the TRUSTe trustmark, this Web site has agreed to notify 
you of the following:</p><ul>
<li>What personally identifiable information is collected from you through the Web site.</li><br>
<li>Which organization is collecting the information.</li><br> 
<li>How the information is used.</li><br> 
<li>With whom the information may be shared.</li><br> 
<li>What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information.</li><br> 
<li>The kind of security procedures in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration 
of information under Microsoft's control. </li><br>
<li>How you can correct inaccuracies in the information.</li><br>
</ul>
<p>If you have questions regarding this statement, you should first contact MSN
Privacy by e<nobr>-mail</nobr> at MSNPrivacy@msn.com
(or to the local MSN e-mail address, which you can find by following the "privacy statement" link on the MSN home page for your country).
If you do not receive acknowledgement of 
your inquiry or if your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then 
contact TRUSTe by visiting the TRUSTe site at www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog.html 
and following the "Contact Us" link. TRUSTe will serve as a liaison with MSN to resolve your concerns.</p>

<p class=header2>Collection of Your Personal Information </p>

<p>At some sites, MSN collects personally identifiable information, such as your e-mail address, 
name, home or work address or telephone number. At other sites, MSN collects anonymous demographic
 information, that is not unique to you, such as your zip code, age, gender, preferences, 
 interests and favorites. Some sites collect a combination of the two types of information.
  Information collected at one MSN Web site may be shared within the MSN family of Web sites.</p>

<p>MSN does not associate sensitive data, such as your race, religion, or political affiliations,
with personally identifiable information. MSN takes precautions to segregate any sensitive 
data you may provide on MSN sites and services that reference your race, religion, 
sexual orientation, ethnicity or political affiliations.</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information
 or personally sensitive data through MSN Chats, MSN Communities, or other public 
 online forums, this information may be collected and used by others.</p> 
<p><b>Note:</b> MSN does not read any of your private online communications. 
 Your MSN Chat conversations, MSN Messenger messages, Hotmail&reg; e-mails, and MSN Internet Access 
 <nobr>e-mails</nobr> are completely confidential.</p>

<p>MSN encourages you to review the privacy statements of Web sites you choose to link to 
from MSN so that you can understand how those Web sites collect, use and share your 
information. Microsoft is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content
on Web sites outside of the Microsoft and MSN family of Web sites.</p>

<p>There is also information about your computer hardware and software that is 
automatically collected by MSN and may be shared with other Web sites within
the Microsoft family of Web sites. This information can include: your IP address,
browser type, domain names, access times and referring Web site addresses. 
This information is used by MSN for the operation of the service, 
to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use 
of the MSN Web sites.</p>

<p class=header2>Use of Your Personal Information</p>

<p<MSN Web sites and their operational service partners collect and use your personal information 
to operate MSN Web sites and deliver the services you have requested.
MSN sites also use your personally identifiable information to inform you
of other products or services available from Microsoft and its affiliates.
MSN may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services 
or of potential new services that may be offered.</p>

<p>MSN does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. MSN may, from time to time,
contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of
interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name,
address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. In addition, MSN may share 
data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis. All such third parties are
prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to Microsoft,
and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.</p>

<p>MSN keeps track of the Web sites and pages our customers visit within MSN, in order to 
determine what MSN sites and services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver 
customized content and advertising within MSN to customers whose behavior indicates that 
they are interested in a particular subject area.</p>

<p>MSN Web sites will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required
 to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: 
 (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served 
 on Microsoft or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Microsoft or
 an MSN Web site; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal 
 safety of users of Microsoft, its web sites, or the public.</p>

<p class=header2>Use of Cookies</p>

<p>Many MSN Web sites use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience.
A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. 
Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely 
assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>

<p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time.
Cookies tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page.
 For example, if you personalize MSN's pages, or register with MSN sites or services, 
 a cookie helps MSN to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. 
 This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses,
  shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same MSN Web site, 
  the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the MSN 
  features that you customized.</p>

<p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept 
cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer.
 If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive
  features of the MSN services or Web sites you visit.</p>

<p class=header2>Use of Web Beacons</p>

<p>MSN Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons, sometimes called 
"single-pixel gifs," that allow MSN to count users who have visited those pages and to 
deliver co-branded services. Web beacons are not used to access your personally 
identifiable information on the MSN network of sites and services. They are used to compile aggregated statistics about MSN Web site usage.</p>

<p>Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, 
time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the Web 
beacon resides. MSN Web pages may also contain Web beacons placed there by our 
advertising partner, Avenue A, to help MSN determine the effectiveness of our 
Internet advertising campaigns.</p>

<p class=header2>Use of Third Party Ad Networks</p>

<p>The majority of the online banner advertisements you see on MSN Web sites are displayed by MSN.</p>

<p>In addition, MSN also allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, 
to display advertisements on MSN Web sites. To do this, ad networks place a persistent cookie 
on your computer. Doing this allows the ad network to recognize your computer each time 
they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad networks may compile information 
about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and 
determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver 
advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. Microsoft does not 
have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third-party ad 
servers or ad networks.</p>

<p>MSN maintains relationships with a number of the third-party ad networks currently operating 
such as: 24/7 Media; AdForce; AdKnowledge; AppNet/admaximize/i33; Avenue A; BlueStreak.com; 
CFM&Z; Click Here; DoubleClick; Flycast; Interad Network; MatchLogic; Mediaplex; Sabela Media; 
The Thinking Media; and Vita Bella.</p>

<p>If you want to prevent one of these third-party companies from sending and reading 
cookies on your computer, you will need to visit each ad network's
Web site individually and request that you be removed from its system.</p>

<p class=header2>Control of Your Personal Information</p>

<p>MSN offers its customers choices for the collection, use and sharing of personal information. 
You may go to the MSN Communications Preferences page to proactively make choices about the 
use and sharing of your personal information. You may choose not to receive unsolicited marketing 
material from MSN Web sites and services or unsolicited marketing material on behalf of external 
third party business partners.</p>

<p>In addition, you may visit the "MSN Personal Information Center" to view, edit or delete your 
personal information from the MSN database. Not all sites are represented at this time. 
Additional MSN sites and services will be added to the Center in the future.</p>

<p>In both cases described above, you will be asked to make your requests while logged
into a Microsoft Passport account, so that MSN can associate your preferences with a
 particular account. This security safeguard prevents someone else from making choices 
 about the usage and control of your personal information.</p>

<p>You may also stop the delivery of future promotional e-mail from MSN Web sites 
by following the specific instructions in the e-mail you receive. The instructions 
explain how to stop receiving such e-mails.</p>

<p>There are some Web sites, including MSN Internet Access and MSN Hotmail&reg;, that send 
out periodic e-mails informing you of technical service issues, product surveys,
new feature announcements and news about MSN products and services. These e-mails
 are considered essential to the provision of the service you have requested. 
 You will not be able to choose to unsubscribe to these mailings, as they are 
 considered a part of the service you have chosen.</p>

<p class=header2>Security of Your Personal Information</p>

<p>MSN secures your personal information from unauthorized access, 
use or disclosure. MSN secures the personally identifiable information you provide on 
computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access,
use or disclosure. Personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to 
other Web sites through the use of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encrypted protection.</p>

<p class=header2>Protection of Children's Personal Information</p>

<p>MSN offers a Kids Passport account to allow parents to give consent for the collection, use and
sharing of their children's (ages 12 and under) personal information online. To learn more about
this service, visit Kids Passport on www.passport.com.</p>

<p class = header2>Changes to this Statement</p>

<p>MSN will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect company and customer feedback.
When MSN posts changes to this Statement, you will see the word "updated" next to the Privacy 
Statement link on the front page of MSN. To see the latest version, go to http://www.msn.com and 
click on the link <b> TRUSTe Approved Privacy Statement </b>at the bottom of the page</b>
(or follow the "privacy statement" link on the MSN home page for your country).</p>

<p class = header2>Enforcement of this Statement of Privacy</p>

<p>As a licensee of TRUSTe, and upholding our commitment to protect the privacy of your
personal information, Microsoft has agreed to disclose its information practices and to
 have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. If you have questions 
 regarding this statement, you should first contact MSN via e-mail. If you do not receive
 acknowledgement of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed,
 you should then contact TRUSTe at www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog.html. TRUSTe 
 will serve as a liaison with MSN to resolve your concerns.</p>

<p class = header2>Contact Information</p>

<p>Microsoft welcomes your comments regarding this Statement of Privacy. 
If you believe that Microsoft has not adhered to this Statement, please contact Microsoft 
by telephone, e-mail, or postal mail.</p>

<p class="title">Is it safe to send credit card information over the Internet?</p>
<p>You can safely send your credit card information over the Internet because MSN 
uses secure server technology and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to securely
 transmit your credit card number over the Internet. </p>

<p>Secure Sockets Layer is the industry standard in Web security. 
It is used primarily to transmit sensitive information over the Internet. 
When you have a secure connection between your browser and a Web site, 
no one else can easily access the data that you send across the connection.
 MSN uses SSL to encrypt your sign-in name, password, and wallet to
  give you a high level of security.</p> 

<p>Occasionally, your browser might display security alerts
 to notify you that you are entering or leaving a secure connection. 
 These alerts tell you when MSN is taking precautions to keep your private information 
 (such as your password) secure while it travels from
  your computer to the MSN server. This is normal, and you can choose to continue 
  when these alerts appear.</p>

<p class="title">About Passport wallet</p>
				
<p>Your Passport wallet is much like the wallet you carry around in your back pocket or your purse.
When you enter a retail shop and you see something you want to buy, you
pull out your wallet and choose the appropriate credit card to hand to the merchant.
After the merchant authorizes your card, you get the merchandise, and you're on your way.</p>

<p>Your Passport wallet works in a similar way when you shop online, and you can use it at
a growing number of online merchants. In your Passport wallet, you can store as many credit
cards and shipping addresses as you want. When you make an online
purchase, you choose which card and shipping address you want to use, and you send only
that information to the online merchant over a secure connection. The online merchant then
uses the information to authorize and deliver your purchase.</p>

<p>By storing your credit card and address information in your Passport wallet, you won't have to
retype it every time you make an online purchase. This makes your online purchases safer and faster.
</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Your wallet accepts all major credit and charge cards, as well as debit 
cards that do not require a PIN (personal identification number) to use.</p>
<p>To learn more about Passport wallet, go to www.passport.com.</p><br>
