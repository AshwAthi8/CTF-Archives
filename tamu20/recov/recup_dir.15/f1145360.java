                Using Remote Assistance, you can allow someone you know to connect to your computer over the Internet, chat with you, and observe your computer screen as you work. With your permission, this person can also share control of your computer. You can also offer Remote Assistance to a client computer.
                <br><br>
                You can also visit a support newsgroup to find a peer to help you figure out the best way to use Microsoft products.
                <br><br>
                The Support page can give you access to assistance from your computer manufacturer and — if you acquired your copy of Windows separately — from Microsoft.

                If you're not connected to the Internet, you can use other tools to solve problems:

                <li id=locDesc3>Advanced System Information and System Configuration Utility provide technical details that support professionals can use to help solve problems.</li>
